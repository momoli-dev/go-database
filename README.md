# go-database

These are the common database utilities used across various Go projects.

Most features are mainly focused on PostgreSQL with the support of PostGIS, using pgx as the database driver.

## Examples

Here are some code snippets demonstrating the usage of the package. You may also refer to the tests for more examples.

### New Connection

Start by creating the handler:

```go
conn := NewConn(ctx, &ConnParams{
    Addr: "postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname",
    HasPostgis: true,
})
defer conn.Close(ctx)
```

### Transaction Management

Transaction management is done through the `context.Context` object. They can be nested and each level will join the 
outer transaction. Outer most transaction will be committed or rolled back.

```go
// Functions are safe to call even if not in a transaction.
conn.BeginTx(ctx)
defer RollbackTx(ctx)

Tx(ctx)
InTx(ctx)
CommitTx(ctx)
```

### conn.WithTx Helper Method

`conn.WithTx` helper, provides a convenient way to run a function within a transaction

```go
conn.WithTx(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Do some database operations here
    if err != nil {
        // If an error is returned, the transaction will be rolled back
        return err
    }

    // If nil is returned, the transaction will be committed
    return nil
})
```

`conn.WithTx` can be nested, just like the transaction management functions.

```go
conn.WithTx(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) error {
    conn.WithTx(ctx, func(ctx context.Context) error {
        // Do some database operations here
        return nil
    })
    return nil
})
```

### Generic WithTx Function

Generic `WithTx` function is also provided for convenience, allowing the caller to return an additional result from
inner function.

```go
// A generic WithTx function is also provided for convenience
res, err := WithTx(ctx, conn, func(ctx context.Context) (T, error) {
    // Do some database operations here
    return res, nil
})
```
